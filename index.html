      <h2 class="intro__title">What have we not seen there?</h2>
      <p class="intro__text">According to VCIOM surveys, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere, but only 36% plan to spend their vacation in their own country. Well, what haven't we seen here, at home? In fact, Russia is a whole universe with the gentle sea of the south, dense forests of Sayan, and the harsh ice of the Putorana Plateau. Moreover, you can see all these beauties without millions in your bank account, a passport, and long flights. Like Vera Bashmakova - a brave young mother who took her three children, packed them into her "Lada" car, and traveled 20,000 kilometers in her own country. We have chosen and described some interesting places worthy of your vacation.</p>

            and the rippling waves of the Baltic Sea 
            on the other hand. A unique natural area on the edge of the Russian enclave.</p>
          <p class="place__paragraph">The Kaliningrad region does not end there. For the traveler and explorer, there's also Russia's westernmost point, the Baltic Spit, next door, and the German heritage of a placer of small seaside towns. The atmosphere of the area eliminates the hustle and bustle, enveloping you in the tranquility of nature and the smell of the steely, cool sea.</p>

            of your school geography lessons. Maybe you are not interested in super-deep well, penetrating through the Earth's crust, and apatites made you feel apathetic for a long time. But your dream of seeing the northern lights is starting to come true with a ticket
            to Murmansk.</p>

          <p class="place__paragraph">Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia. 
            First of all because of the mountains: if you drive along the ridge, you will see slopes studded with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes. And if you open 
            the windows of the car, you can get a glimpse 
            the invisible miracle of this place - the mountain air.</p>
          <p class="place__paragraph">The climate in Altai is temperate, so it's best to go here in summer. This way you can see the variety of local flora and fauna. Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges, 
            and on the plains roe deer graze. And the famous Pallas' cats are also inhabitants of the Altai region.</p>

          <p class="place__paragraph">Everyone knows Baikal as the largest lake 
            in the world. Many people also know that it is the largest source of fresh water and one of 
            one of the most beautiful places in Russia.</p>
          <p class="place__paragraph">Of course, that's all true. But Baikal is also an ideal place for skijoring competitions. It's a sport where a skier ties himself to a motorcycle, and the tandem tries to develop as much speed as possible on the ice. In March 2019, a world record of 197.011 km/h was set at the Baikal Mile Festival.</p>

          <p class="place__paragraph">Siberia ends not in the Urals, but in Karelia: the Siberian larch, which forms the taiga, does not grow west of Vodlozero. But here it reaches up to 30 meters - the forests of Karelian national parks have never known an axe because of the impassable swamps. Some pines are more than half a millennium old. Touch a living creature that saw the sun before Ivan the Terrible saw it. In the virgin forest for a hundred kilometers you will not find a trail. And on rare paths, trees a few meters from the ground are marked with bear claws. So that everyone knows who is the master here.</p>
